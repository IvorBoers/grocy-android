[Grocy](https://grocy.info/) is a self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home.

Grocy Android uses grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your smartphone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.

**This app requires a running self-hosted instance of the [grocy server application](https://grocy.info/).**  
It is a **companion** app, therefore it **cannot run standalone** or manage products itself.  
You can try it using the demo option available on the login screen.

## Compatibility

Grocy Android requires at least Android 5.0 Lollipop on your device and [grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy/releases) `2.7.0` on your server.  
It is also possible to use the grocy Add-on on a [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) server. Our In-app help explains how to do that.

**Self-signed certificates are not supported at the moment** but an implementation is planned.  
Right now, the server certificate has to be signed by a [certificate authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). This CA has to be public and trusted by Android.  
To meet these requirements, you can use a free certificate from [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) for proper `https` encryption.

## Contribution

If you run into a bug or miss a feature, feel free to give feedback in the app, [send us an email](mailto:patrick@zedler.xyz) or [open an issue](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/issues/new) in this repository.

Like the grocy project, Grocy Android can be translated, too. The main language is English, but we also maintain the German translation because it's our mother tongue.
You can help translating this project at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/grocy-android/grocy-android), if your language is incomplete or not available yet.
Translations which reached a completion level of 80% will be included in releases.

Completed translations: French & Swedish
